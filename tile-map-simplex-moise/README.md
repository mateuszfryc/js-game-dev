## Perlin Noise Simulation
Simple simulation with couple of options to play with.

## Tech stack
- JS ES6, CSS, HTML5
- Perlin and Simplex noise implementation thanks to [https://github.com/josephg/noisejs](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs)
- [Pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/) for GPU rendering
- [Range Slider](https://github.com/stbaer/rangeslider-js)

## Current build


### TO DO:
- [ ] wave direction circle (clock like) widget
- [ ] zoom / tiles size range slider
- [ ] event handler for window size change
- [ ] Perlin's first / smiplex noise switch
- [ ] propper round/clamp of noise samples
- [ ] dynamic number of tiles (meaby up to defined max number, to keep array the same size)
